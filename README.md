# Entangled Representations

Exploratory research project analyzing the relationship between sycophancy and hallucination in instruction-tuned large language models.

The project tests whether excessive agreeableness functions as a causal trigger for factual fabrication under social pressure.

The pipeline implements:
- A multi-stage behavioral probe ("Bait & Switch") derived from TruthfulQA
- Contrastive vector extraction across model layers
- Inference-time activation steering with control and placebo conditions

This repository contains experimental code and analysis pipelines for behavioral, geometric, and causal evaluation.

**Status:** Active research project. Additional analyses and results will be added as experiments complete.
