# Entangled Representations (in progress)

Exploratory research project analyzing the relationship between sycophancy and hallucination
in instruction-tuned large language models.

The project implements:
- A multi-stage behavioral probe ("Bait & Switch")
- Contrastive vector extraction across model layers
- Inference-time activation steering with control conditions

This repository contains experimental code and analysis pipelines.
Results are preliminary and experiments are ongoing.
